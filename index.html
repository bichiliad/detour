                  Based in Austin, but raised in the forests of upstate New York, Mirko draws musical inspiration from the idiosyncrasies of the varied environments he encountes. Born from a tradition of live jazz performance  his high-contrast, unapologetic sets transform the dance floor into a space where unforgiving industrial techno meets curiously human flourishes. Mirko's first two releases on the Blank Slate imprint showcase the diversity of his output, from jazz-inspired techno to classically-inspired acid house. As a member of Detour, Mirko has helped craft unique audiovisual experiences, playing sets with B-Tracks, Terrence Dixon, and Jacques Renault.

                <p>
                  DJ and producer Gusto was born and raised in the Bronx, surrounded by hip-hop and R&B. His biggest influence, however, is the 90s house and techno music from the NYC club scene that his older sister loved and played for him endlessly. After moving to Pittsburgh, he joined WRCT 88.3FM, where he discovered his love of funk and disco, and has been fine-tuning his DJ style to incorporate all of his favorite genres ever since. A part of the growing electronic music scene in Pittsburgh, Gusto has opened for artists such as Jacques Renault, Terrance Dixon, Passion Pit, and Claude Von Stroke.

                  A San Francisco native, Chloé’s musical interest shifted from classical cello to electronic music when she moved to Pittsburgh and began DJing two years ago. She has since adopted a penchant for tech-house, deep house, and techno. Though her music taste is increasingly influenced by Pittsburgh’s raw aesthetic, Chloé remains true to San Francisco’s cleaner house roots. She has played with San Francisco producers at a number of house parties in the Bay Area, with local DJs affiliated with WRCT 88.3FM, and with Poupon in Pittsburgh. Chloé is currently living in Berlin and helping manage Detour’s label, distribution, and upcoming bookings.

                  Originally from New York, it was not until he came to Pittsburgh that the thought of DJing appeared on Naeem’s radar. Through spending time at WRCT 88.3FM, Naeem discovered many new sounds and types of music, and ultimately was inspired to try his hand at DJing. Although he was initially interested in mixing hip-hop, he soon found a groove mixing house and techno. His practice eventually paid off as he began to play out at WRCT’s annual dance parties and at other local venues. He often strays away from a 4/4 beat to more erratic rhythms, creating eclectic sets. Naeem has opened for many acts in Pittsburgh including RL Grime, Jim-E Stack, and Dubbel Dutch and Rizzla

                  a.p. grew up on post-punk and goth rock in the space between Baltimore and Washington DC. His move to Pittsburgh coincided with a new love of the industrial techno of Berlin and the gritty bass lines of South London. While in Pittsburgh, he developed his DJ style for four years on WRCT 88.3FM's airwaves on his weekly radio shows. Although his style shifts from set to set, a.p. always presents his listeners with devious sonic contortions that push the lower end of the frequency spectrum. A newcomer to the Pittsburgh scene, a.p. has opened for artists such as RL Grime, Terrence Dixon, Paolo Rocco, and B-Tracks.
